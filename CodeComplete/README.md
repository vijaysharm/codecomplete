#  Code Complete

## TODOs

List of characters used in all solutions (90 characters):  !"$%&'()*+,-./012345689:;<=>?ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}

### Version X
	* [ ] Analytics: count working/failing solution, # of completed questions
	* [ ] Tabs: Behavioral, System, Coding, Data Structures, Community	
	* [ ] System Expert Prompt: Many systems design questions are intentionally left very vague and are literally given in the form of `Design Foobar`. It's your job to ask clarifying questions to better understand the system that you have to build.
	We've laid out some of these questions below; their answers should give you some guidance on the problem. Before looking at them, we encourage you to take few minutes to think about what questions you'd ask in a real interview.
	* [ ] System Expert Solution: Our solution walkthroughs are meant to supplement our video solutions. We recommend starting with the video solution and using the walkthrough either as a point of reference while you watch the video or as a review tool if you need to brush up on this question's solution later on.
	* [ ] Create Video ad for app store
	* [ ] Show Progress (0 of 100 questions completed)
	* [ ] Add countdown timer (currenly have count-up timer)
      * [ ] If compilation error happens, and console is shown, should we show a toast to say "go back to code"? 
	* [ ] Analytics
	* [ ] Fix bst-construction and linked-list-construction tests
	* [ ] Sort problems appropriately
	* [ ] Improve code highlighting in source code editor
	* [ ] Improve overall app styling
	* [ ] Implement Filter button
	* [ ] Implement "starring" questions [Maybe require login?]
	* [ ] Support themes
	* [ ] Implement "whiteboard" mode. Allow users to write their answers on a canvas
		* [ ] Is it possible to convert the handwritten code to actual code to be run?
	* [ ] Add toast suggesting the user take a hint after X seconds of idle
	* [ ] Support increasing font size
	* [ ] Have user editable tests

## Recreating chai.js file

Currently, we're using chai.js to run the tests in the JSON files. The last version of chai used was 4.2.0. In case it ever needs to be recreate that file, here are the steps I took

	* in the Resources directory of this project, run `npm init -y`
	* Add chai as a dependency `npm install chai --save`
	* Add a file to the directory named `main.js` and add the following line `module.exports.chai = require('chai');`
	* Make sure you have browserify installed. Version last used to generate the file is `16.5.1`, installed with command `npm install -g browserify`
	* Generate the chai.js file as follows: `browserify main.js --standalone Chai > chai.js`
	* Add the file to Xcode. Note that the Javascript engine expects tthe file to be named chai.js

## Deploying to store

	* Not tested yet, however, we're currently configured to use Fastlane. When a successful deployment is complete, update this doc. 
	* The last deploy was done manually through Xcode. May need to copy Fastlane configuration from Colouring book.

## Fixing tests

	There are some tests in the JSON file that don't work. I ended up using the index.js file in the ~/programming/node/code directory to generate tests using the JSONTests and JSONAnswers from the json file. If the tests arent obviously generated, or are failing, I would copy the generated tests and copy them into the index.js file found in the resources directory of this project. Then you can run the test in a browser to see where it might be failing.
